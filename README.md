## Anagrams

### Intro

Developers are often asked to complete code challenges during job interviews.  Here's some good practice with the sort of code challenge you might encounter while interviewing for a developer role.  You’ll use JavaScript to take two given strings, determine if they are anagrams, and return true if they are or false if they are not.  In case you don't remember what an anagram is, it's when you can scramble the letters of one word or phrase to make another word with the exact same count of each letter in the original word.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, clicking the "Test" button will reveal your results.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out in the `#code-adventures` channel in your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
